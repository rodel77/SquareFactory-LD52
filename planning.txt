Delta
- People appear
- They have specific ideas (maybe shapes)
- Join them or break their relation
- Everything unbalance

Engine:
- Someone without relations may disappear (finishing the game)
- Each person can have a "upgraded" relation
- People may change their ideas:
    - They get ideas from other relations
    - They may lose ideas other relations don't have
    - They may get ideas of near nodes (but not related) getting your relations angry
- Persons may upgrade their relation with other people, losing completely the old one

Iteration 1:
- Each "turn" someone speaks
- Everyone near or connected will hear their ideas
